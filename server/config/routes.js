// this is our routes.js file located at /server/config/routes.js
// this file processes get and post requests from the factories
// routes will then call on the server controller functions

// this file will be called on by the main server.js file and it will be passed the app variable. 

// the routes.js file must require all of the server controllers("the exact route from the base file") in order to call upon their functions
